# Scenario 03 - Mortgages

Your team is responsible for one or more microservices used to manage all mortgages for a large online banking system. The microservices in question will be responsible for managing mortgage rates, origination, servicing, refinancing, home equity loans, and defaults.

Your microservices may utilize 3rd party applications or systems behind the scenes for things like interest rate determination, integration with insurance companies for verifying and linking homeowners insurance with the loan, or integration with other banks as part of refinance management. Additionally, your team should consider requirements around fraud detection and prevention.
