# Scenario 02 - Consumer Banking

Your team is responsible for one or more microservices used to manage all consumer banking (checking & savings account activity) for a large online banking system. The microservices in question will be responsible for managing deposits, withdrawals, and transfers across a given customer's accounts.

Your microservices may utilize 3rd party applications or systems behind the scenes for things like automated bill payment to external parties or for transfers to or from accounts at other banks. Additionally, your team should consider requirements around fraud detection and prevention.
