# Scenario 04 - Credit Cards

Your team is responsible for one or more microservices used to manage all credit cards for a large online banking system. The microservices in question will be responsible for managing interest rates, opening & closing of accounts, default, and servicing.

Your microservices may utilize 3rd party applications or systems behind the scenes for things like interest rate determination or integration with credit reporting agencies for verifying or reporting a customer's credit rating. Additionally, your team should consider requirements around fraud detection and prevention.
